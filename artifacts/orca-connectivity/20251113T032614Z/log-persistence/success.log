[UTC 2025-11-13T03:26:14Z] WebORCA log persistence override completed.
1. Copied docker/orca/jma-receipt-docker/docker-compose.override.yml.example to docker-compose.override.yml and enabled bind mount ./logs/orca:/opt/jma/weborca/log.
2. Created host log dir via `mkdir -p docker/orca/jma-receipt-docker/logs/orca`.
3. Recreated container with `docker compose up -d --force-recreate orca` (platform warning expected on arm64 host).
4. Verified LOGDIR by `docker exec jma-receipt-docker-orca-1 grep LOGDIR /opt/jma/weborca/app/etc/jma-receipt.env` -> LOGDIR=/opt/jma/weborca/log.
5. Host log mount populated under docker/orca/jma-receipt-docker/logs/orca.
