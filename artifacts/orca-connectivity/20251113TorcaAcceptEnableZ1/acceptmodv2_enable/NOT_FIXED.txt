Summary:
- Verified existing /opt/jma/weborca/app/etc/receipt_route.ini; file matches template with ALLOW_METHODS=OPTIONS,GET,POST for [orca11].
- Collected online.env and jma-receipt.env. Neither file contains API_ENABLE_* keys as required by ORCA_CONNECTIVITY_VALIDATION.md §4.5 "API enable 手順".
- Captured env | grep 'API|ROUTE|HYBRID' (empty) showing that API_ENABLE_ACCEPT=1 等の環境変数は未定義。
- Executed curl -sv -X POST http://localhost:8000/orca11/acceptmodv2?class=01 (Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded, dummy=1). Response was HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed (Allow: OPTIONS, GET). See ../httpdump/orca11_acceptmodv2/.
- docker logs --since 30m shows "System Error:405 code=405" at 2025/11/13 19:38:04 (JST) confirming POST 405 persists after route template confirmation.

Blocking Factors:
- Without documented API_ENABLE_ACCEPT / API_ENABLE_ORCA11 flags, route configuration alone cannot enable POST.
- online.env ownership is root:root and lacks API_ENABLE_* toggles; reapplying template would require restart that is prohibited in W59 scope.

Next Actions Suggested:
1. Follow Runbook §4.5 Step3 to escalate to WebORCA support for official API_ENABLE_* exposure procedure.
2. Once acceptable instructions are provided, populate online.env with API_ENABLE_ACCEPT=1 (and related API groups) and re-test POST after allowed restart.
