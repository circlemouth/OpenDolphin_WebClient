STAGE ACCESS ATTEMPT: curl -I http://stage.open-dolphin
  -> curl: (6) Could not resolve host: stage.open-dolphin
OBSERVATION: With the stage proxy host unresolved the UI cannot reach the Modernized server, so dataSourceTransition=server / missingMaster flows could not be exercised.
SCREENSHOT: artifacts/webclient/e2e/20251205T200000Z-reception/reception-stage.png
NOTE: Need to rerun once stage.open-dolphin becomes resolvable so charts/reception can load real audit flags.
